Get ready to dust off your racing gear because it's time hit the road and burn some rubber! Put yourself in the shoes of Daniel Morales as you race around Marselles with your modified Peugoet 406. From blowing up police radars to skiing down mountains in your car, you have no limits.

## Synopsis

A famous secret agent with striking similarities to James Bond needs to get the airport, and fast. Show him what you're made of.

Petra, now married to Detective Emilien, has just annouced that she is pregnant and you are in the midst of a relationship crisis. Lilly, your girlfriend, has walked out on you after finding you customizing the taxi at four in the morning. Lilly believes that she is also pregnant and you are tasked with driving her to the hospital without her father finding out.

A group of thieves dressed as Santa Claus are wreaking havoc, and the Marseille police are, as usual, unable to keep up. Superintendent Gibert is distracted by a Chinese journalist, Qiu, writing a story on his squad, and is unsuccessful in stopping the robbers.

Qiu is captured by the Santa Claus Gang and is taken to the Alps, where she is revealed to be their leader.
